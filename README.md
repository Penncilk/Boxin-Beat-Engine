# Boxin-Beat-Engine
A engine for my new Rythm game inspired by Boxing

Feel free to use this engine for your own rythm games, If you make a cool change to the engine for your game, show your source code, but charts, and songs are not part of this requirement.

HOW TO PLAY:

Click to the beat! your coach will tell you a number, and you will have to repeat it with a punch!

The controls are styled based off of Punch Out, however in the future, there will be a keyconfig

(^ and v are arrow keys for up and down)

X = 1
Z = 2
-> = 3
<- = 4
^ + X = 5
v + Z = 6
v = 7

Have fun, and enjoy
